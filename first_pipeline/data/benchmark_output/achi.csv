0,0,A valid move,"No, Player 1 cannot capture Player 2's piece on the middle point of the upper side of the inner square. Capturing only occurs when a player places three of their own pieces in a row on the intersections of the lines. Since Player 1's move does not create a three-in-a-row pattern, they cannot remove Player 2's piece."

2,2,A valid move,"No, that move is not valid because Player 1 has already captured the piece at the middle point of the right side of the inner square. Player 2 cannot place a piece on that intersection anymore."
3,3,A valid move,"No, that move is not valid. The players can only move their pieces along the lines connecting the intersections. Moving from the outer square to the inner square is not allowed in this game."
