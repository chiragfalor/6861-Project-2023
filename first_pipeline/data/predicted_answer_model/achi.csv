"No, Player 1 cannot capture Player 2's piece on the middle point of the upper side of the inner square at this point. Capturing an opponent's piece is only allowed when a player places three of their pieces in a row during the placement phase. In this case, Player 2 has only placed one piece on the inner square, so there is no row of three pieces yet. Therefore, Player 1 cannot capture any of Player 2's pieces at this stage of the game.",A valid move because player 1 has three of their marks on the right side of the outer square forming a line.
"No, that is not a valid move. According to the rules of Achi, players can only place their pieces on the intersections of the lines. The upper left corner of the outer square is not an intersection point, so Player 2 cannot place their piece there.",An invalid move because player 1's piece is on the upper left corner of the outer square.
"No, this move is not valid. According to the rules of Achi, players are not allowed to place their pieces on intersections that are already occupied by another piece. Since the middle point of the right side of the inner square already has a piece placed by Player 1, Player 2 cannot place their piece there.",A valid move because currently there is no piece on the middle point of the right side of the inner square.
"No, that move is not valid. In the ""Movement"" phase of the game, players can only move their pieces to an adjacent point along the lines. The middle point of the right side of the inner square is not adjacent to the middle point of the right side of the outer square.","A valid move because currently there is no piece on the the upper left corner of the outer square, and a piece is allowed to move to an adjacent spot along the line."
