9,9,"A valid move because currently there is no piece on the 3rd row, 3rd column, and a piece is allowed to move into an adjacent orthogonal empty cell","No, this is not a valid move. Player 1's pieces are not on the 4th row at the start and until now he only moved on the 1st and 2nd rows. So player 1 doesn't have a piece at the 4th row, 3rd column to move."
