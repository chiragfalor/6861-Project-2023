"No, this move would not be valid. In the game of Achi, a piece can only be captured if player 1 forms a line of three of their own pieces along the lines of the board. Simply moving a piece onto the position of an opponent's piece does not capture it. Furthermore, piece capturing is only possible after the placement phase is over.",A valid move because player 1 has three of their marks on the right side of the outer square forming a line.
"No, this is not a valid move. The upper left corner of the outer square was already occupied by Player 1, as you mentioned in your first game move instruction. In this game, a player can only place their piece on an unoccupied intersection. Hence, Player 2 needs to choose a different location that is currently unoccupied.",An invalid move because player 1's piece is on the upper left corner of the outer square.
"No, this move isn't valid anymore. Player 2 cannot place their piece on the middle point of the right side of the inner square, because Player 1 has recently taken that spot by capturing Player 2's piece. According to the Achi game rules, a player can only place their piece on empty spots on the board, which means the spot is not currently occupied by any player's piece.",A valid move because currently there is no piece on the middle point of the right side of the inner square.
"No, this is not a valid move. According to the rules of the Achi game described, once all pieces are placed, players can only move a piece to an adjacent point along the lines. The move from the middle point of the right side of the outer square to the middle point of the right side of the inner square is not an adjacent move, so it is not valid.","A valid move because currently there is no piece on the the upper left corner of the outer square, and a piece is allowed to move to an adjacent spot along the line."
